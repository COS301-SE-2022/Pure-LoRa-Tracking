// This file contains a number of compile-time settings that can be set on (=1) or off (=0)
// The disadvantage of compile time is minor compared to the memory gain of not having
// too much code compiled and loaded on your ESP device.
//
// NOTE: 
// If version is for ESP32 Heltec board, compile with ESP32 setting and board 
// "ESP32 Dev Module" or "Heltec WiFi Lora 32"
// 
// For ESP8266 Wemos: compile with "Wemos R1 D1" and choose
// the right _PIN_OUT below. Selecting Oled while that is not connected does not 
// really matter (so you can leave that in).
//
// The source has been optimized for PlatformIO usage. That means some variables
// can be defined in the .platformio.ini file. Please look at the example file to see 
// how to set these #defines
