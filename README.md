## Harbinger - Pure Lora - Project Description

Pure LoRa tracking is a system used to track and monitor endangered wildlife through lower power IoT technology (LoRaWAN). The system monitors wildlife with sensors attached to the animals relaying packet data (Strength and Time of flight) to gateway devices. The gateway devices transmits the data over the internet to a server to be stored. The stored data is processed using the location of each tower to then calculate the approximate location of each sensor.
The stored data will be processed using the location of each tower to calculate the approximate location of each sensor. The management portal is used to view the maps, sensors and tracking data of diffent parks and to manage parks, LoRaWAN Devices and staff.
